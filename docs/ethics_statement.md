# Ethics Statement — COS™ Blockchain Compliance Tracker

COS™ is built on the principle that governance must be **transparent, accountable, and sustainable**. Ethics is not optional — it is the foundation of trust in both AI and infrastructure projects.

## Transparency
- Every compliance and oversight event is logged on‑chain with a verifiable transaction ID (TxID).
- Immutable blockchain records are extended into OriginTrail DKG Knowledge Assets (JSON‑LD/RDF with provenance).
- Dashboards provide real‑time visibility for donors, managers, and communities.

## Accountability
- Oversight logs are mapped to auditors, contractors, and agencies.
- Reputation scores are computed from verified compliance events and ESG contributions.
- Negligence is exposed, and ethical performance is rewarded.

## Sustainability
- ESG metrics are aggregated into a Sustainability Index.
- Climate resilience and social inclusion are embedded into governance workflows.
- Communities gain assurance that sustainability claims are backed by immutable records.

## Privacy & Security
- Sensitive data remains off‑chain; only hashes are committed.
- Role‑based access and encryption secure repositories.
- COS™ aligns with global standards (CMAA, FIDIC, ISO, UNDP ESG).

## Openness
- Licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)**.
- Demo scripts, fallback outputs, and reproducibility assets are openly available.
- Academic credibility established via Zenodo DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.17620309](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17620309).
