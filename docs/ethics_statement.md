# 🌍 Ethics Statement — COS™ Blockchain Compliance Tracker

COS™ is built on the principle that governance must be **transparent, accountable, sustainable, and open**.  
Ethics is not optional — it is the foundation of trust in both AI and infrastructure projects.

---

## Transparency
- Every compliance and oversight event is logged on‑chain with a verifiable transaction ID (TxID).  
- Immutable blockchain records are extended into OriginTrail DKG Knowledge Assets (JSON‑LD/RDF with provenance).  
- Dashboards provide real‑time visibility for donors, managers, and communities.  

## Accountability
- Oversight logs are mapped to auditors, contractors, and agencies.  
- Reputation scores are computed from verified compliance events and ESG contributions.  
- Negligence is exposed, and ethical performance is rewarded.  

## Sustainability
- ESG metrics are aggregated into a Sustainability Index.  
- Climate resilience and social inclusion are embedded into governance workflows.  
- Communities gain assurance that sustainability claims are backed by immutable records.  

## Privacy & Security
- Sensitive data remains off‑chain; only hashes are committed.  
- Role‑based access and encryption secure repositories.  
- COS™ aligns with global standards (CMAA, FIDIC, ISO, UNDP ESG).  

## Openness
- Licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)**.  
- Demo scripts, fallback outputs, and reproducibility assets are openly available.  
- Academic credibility established via Zenodo DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.17620309](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17620309).
