# COS™ Governance Framework — Compliance, Oversight, Sustainability

The COS™ Blockchain Compliance Tracker is built on a **tri‑pillar governance framework** designed to embed ethics into both infrastructure and AI systems. Each pillar is mapped into blockchain records and OriginTrail DKG Knowledge Assets, ensuring transparency, accountability, and sustainability.

---

## Pillar 1 — Compliance
- **Audit‑Ready Documentation:** Standards and controls aligned with CMAA, FIDIC, ISO, and donor requirements.
- **Immutable Proofs:** Each compliance event hashed and logged on‑chain with verifiable Tx IDs.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Reduces disputes and governance failures by providing tamper‑proof evidence.
- **Dashboard Integration:** Compliance metrics displayed in real time for donors and managers.

## Pillar 2 — Oversight
- **Ethical Supervision:** Beyond CSR, oversight ensures worker safety, duty of care, and governance integrity.
- **Traceability:** Oversight activities linked to Tx IDs, ensuring accountability of auditors and contractors.
- **Transparency:** Incident reports and corrective actions published as verifiable Knowledge Assets.
- **Reputation Scoring:** Oversight logs mapped into reputation scores, rewarding ethical performance.

## Pillar 3 — Sustainability
- **ESG Metrics:** Environmental, social, and governance indicators aggregated into a Sustainability Index.
- **Climate Resilience:** Projects designed with long‑term sustainability and community impact in mind.
- **Donor Confidence:** Sustainability claims backed by immutable blockchain records.
- **Community Assurance:** Communities gain trust in ethical and sustainable project delivery.

## Integration with OriginTrail DKG
- **Knowledge Assets:** Compliance, oversight, and sustainability events published in JSON‑LD/RDF with provenance.
- **MCP Agents:** Query Knowledge Assets to validate AI outputs against human‑curated facts.
- **Trusted Feeds:** Governance dashboards powered by DKG data, enabling verifiable transparency.

**Summary:**  
The COS™ Governance Framework operationalizes ethics‑first governance by embedding compliance, oversight, and sustainability pillars into blockchain and DKG workflows. This ensures that every governance event is transparent, accountable, and sustainable.
