# 🏆 Hackathon Submission: OriginTrail Scaling Trust in the Age of AI

**Event:** [OriginTrail Global Hackathon 2025](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/origintrail-scaling-trust-ai/detail)  
**Track(s):** 📝 Decentralized Community Notes + 🗣️ Social Graph Reputation  
**Theme:** Ethics‑First Governance for AI and Infrastructure Projects  

---

## 🔧 Project Overview
COS™ Blockchain Compliance Tracker embeds **ethics‑first governance** into AI and donor‑funded infrastructure projects.  
It transforms governance events into **immutable blockchain records** linked to transaction IDs, block numbers, and timestamps.  
These records are extended into **OriginTrail DKG Knowledge Assets**, enabling verifiable compliance, oversight, and sustainability metrics.

---

## ✨ Challenge Alignment

### 📝 Decentralized Community Notes
- **Ethics‑First Logging:** Every compliance and oversight event is recorded as a fact‑check triple (`Event → VerifiedBy → TxID`), ensuring transparency and accountability.  
- **Provenance & Trust:** Notes are published to the OriginTrail DKG in **JSON‑LD/RDF format with provenance**, guaranteeing that each ESG milestone is traceable to its source.  
- **Combating Misinformation:** By linking sustainability claims (e.g., safety inspections, carbon permits, gender inclusion reports) to **verifiable Tx IDs**, COS™ prevents false reporting and deepfakes, reinforcing ethical governance.  

### 🗣️ Social Graph Reputation
- **Accountability Scoring:** Oversight logs are mapped into **reputation scores** for auditors, contractors, and agencies, rewarding ethical performance and exposing negligence.  
- **Transparent Signals:** Scores are computed using **frequency of verified compliance events** and **ESG contributions**, ensuring fairness and openness.  
- **Community Impact:** Published to the DKG for querying, these scores power **trusted feeds and governance dashboards**, giving donors, managers, and communities real‑time visibility into ethical performance.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Blockchain Layer:** Sepolia testnet (Tx IDs verified via Etherscan).  
- **Knowledge Layer:** OriginTrail DKG Edge Node integration (Knowledge Assets published in JSON‑LD/RDF with provenance).  
- **Agent Layer:** MCP agents query compliance notes and ESG metrics.  
- **Trust Layer:** Reputation scores computed and exposed via DKG APIs.  
- **Fallback Demo:** Plain‑text script ensures reproducibility across judge environments.
