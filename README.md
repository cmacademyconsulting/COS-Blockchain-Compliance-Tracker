## 🔧 Project Overview
COS™ Blockchain Compliance Tracker embeds **ethics‑first governance** into AI and donor‑funded infrastructure projects.  
It transforms governance events into **immutable blockchain records** linked to transaction IDs, block numbers, and timestamps.  
These records are extended into **OriginTrail DKG Knowledge Assets**, enabling verifiable compliance, oversight, and sustainability metrics.

---

## ✨ Challenge Alignment

### 📝 Decentralized Community Notes
- **Ethics‑First Logging:** Every compliance and oversight event is recorded as a fact‑check triple (`Event → VerifiedBy → TxID`), ensuring transparency and accountability.  
- **Provenance & Trust:** Notes are published to the OriginTrail DKG in **JSON‑LD/RDF format with provenance**, guaranteeing that each ESG milestone is traceable to its source.  
- **Combating Misinformation:** By linking sustainability claims (e.g., safety inspections, carbon permits, gender inclusion reports) to **verifiable Tx IDs**, COS™ prevents false reporting and deepfakes, reinforcing ethical governance.  

### 🗣️ Social Graph Reputation
- **Accountability Scoring:** Oversight logs are mapped into **reputation scores** for auditors, contractors, and agencies, rewarding ethical performance and exposing negligence.  
- **Transparent Signals:** Scores are computed using **frequency of verified compliance events** and **ESG contributions**, ensuring fairness and openness.  
- **Community Impact:** Published to the DKG for querying, these scores power **trusted feeds and governance dashboards**, giving donors, managers, and communities real‑time visibility into ethical performance.  

---

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Blockchain Layer:** Sepolia testnet (Tx IDs verified via Etherscan).  
- **Knowledge Layer:** OriginTrail DKG Edge Node integration (Knowledge Assets published in JSON‑LD/RDF with provenance).  
- **Agent Layer:** MCP agents query compliance notes and ESG metrics.  
- **Trust Layer:** Reputation scores computed and exposed via DKG APIs.  
- **Fallback Demo:** Plain‑text script ensures reproducibility across judge environments.  

---

## ⚖️ Ethics‑First Commitment
- **Transparency:** Immutable blockchain records linked to DKG Knowledge Assets.  
- **Accountability:** Oversight logs mapped to verifiable Tx IDs.  
- **Sustainability:** ESG metrics aggregated into a Sustainability Index.  
- **Openness:** Licensed under CC BY 4.0, with reproducible demo scripts and Zenodo DOI.

## 🧑‍⚖️ Judge Resources

To make verification simple and judge‑friendly, we provide two complementary resources:

- [Judge Instructions](./judge_instructions.md)  
  Step‑by‑step reproducibility guide with exact commands, demo video, and ethics commitments.

- [Judge Checklist](./judge_checklist.md)  
  One‑page tick‑box table for quick verification of TxIDs, DKG assets, and reproducibility proofs.

👉 Judges can choose either the **detailed walkthrough** or the **quick checklist** depending on their time and preference.

### Judge Checklist
1. Clone repo & install dependencies  
2. Configure `.env` with Infura Project ID + PRIVATE_KEY  
3. Run demo for all five governance events  
4. Verify Tx IDs via Sepolia Etherscan  
5. Review `/appendix/audit_table.csv` for consolidated proof  
6. Watch demo video (2 min) showing governance event → Tx ID → DKG note → reputation score
