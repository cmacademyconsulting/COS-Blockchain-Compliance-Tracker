**Event:** [OriginTrail Global Hackathon 2025](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/origintrail-scaling-trust-ai/detail)  
**Track(s):** 📝 Decentralized Community Notes + 🗣️ Social Graph Reputation  
**Theme:** Ethics‑First Governance for AI and Infrastructure Projects  

---

### 🚀 Quick Start
1. Open https://polkadot.js.org/apps (Westend/Paseo).  
2. Copy a Tx ID from `/appendix/audit_table.csv`.  
3. Paste into the explorer, verify block number and account.  
4. Run demo (`npm run demo` or `npm.cmd run demo`).  
5. Confirm compliance notes and reputation scores published to OriginTrail DKG.  
6. Review `/docs/ethics_statement.md` for governance commitments.

### 🔧 Project Overview
COS™ Blockchain Compliance Tracker embeds **ethics‑first governance** into AI and donor‑funded infrastructure projects. It transforms governance events into **immutable blockchain records** linked to transaction IDs, block numbers, and timestamps. These records are extended into **OriginTrail DKG Knowledge Assets**, enabling verifiable compliance, oversight, and sustainability metrics.

---

### ✨ Challenge Alignment

#### 📝 Decentralized Community Notes
- Logs compliance and oversight events as **fact‑check triples**.  
- Publishes notes to DKG in JSON‑LD/RDF with provenance.  
- Combats misinformation by linking ESG milestones to verifiable Tx IDs.  

#### 🗣️ Social Graph Reputation
- Maps oversight logs into **reputation scores** for auditors, contractors, and agencies.  
- Scores computed using transparent signals (frequency of verified compliance events, ESG contributions).  
- Published to DKG for querying, enabling trusted feeds and governance dashboards.  

---

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Blockchain Layer:** Polkadot Westend/Paseo testnets (Tx IDs verified via Polkadot.js Apps).  
- **Knowledge Layer:** OriginTrail DKG Edge Node integration (Knowledge Assets published in JSON‑LD/RDF with provenance).  
- **Agent Layer:** MCP agents query compliance notes and ESG metrics.  
- **Trust Layer:** Reputation scores computed and exposed via DKG APIs.  
- **Premium Access:** High‑confidence data gated via x402 micropayments.  
- **Fallback Demo:** Plain‑text script ensures reproducibility across judge environments.  

---

### ⚖️ Ethics‑First Commitment
